# Tic Tac Toe

This is a tic-tac-toe game using a SPA (single page application) approach with a sign up and login.  A user must first login to click on a button to show the grid to play the game.  The user will then start by playing 'X' and then 'O', alternating until the game ends.  There are two possible results to a game; win/draw.
